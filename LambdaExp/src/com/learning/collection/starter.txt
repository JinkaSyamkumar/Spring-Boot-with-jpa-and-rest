Collections api is inroduced in JAVA7
A collection is a group of elements - They can store,retrieve , manipulate and communicate and can aggregate the data.

Collection api has following interfaces
	1)Set - a collections that does not contain duplicates.
	2)List - an ordered collection
	3)Map - an object that maps keys to values
	
Collection Interface has methods that does basic operations 
ex
	int size() - returns size of collection
	boolean isEmpty() - returns true/false
	boolean contains(Object element) - checks if an element exists and returns true/false 
	boolean add(E element) - adds element and returns true/false
	boolean remove(Object element) - removes element , returns true and if element not found, returns false
	Iterator<E> iterator() - provides iterator 
	
	n JAVA 8, preferred way of iterating over a collections is to use Stream and aggregator on it --> shown in the example class

##4

In addition to streams discussed in ##3 com.nielsen.stream, it also includes special streams for primitive types

	1)Int Stream
	2)Long Stream
	3)Double Stream
	
Primitive streams use specialized lambda expressions as well like IntFunction instead of Function, IntPredicate instead of Predicate etc

Primitive streams support additional terminal operations apart from what we discussed in #3
	sum
	average

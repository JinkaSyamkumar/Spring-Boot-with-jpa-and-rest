java.util.stream

	This package contains majority of classes and interfaces for using streams.
	It is not part of io stream it is different , newly introduced in java 8
	
	A stream represents a sequence of elements
	
	The stream package was added to traverse collections
	
	Most stream operations take a lambda expression
	
Stream operations are either intermediate or terminal

	Terminal operations are either void or return a type
	Intermediate operations return the stream itself
	
	Intermediate operations are useful to chain multiple message calls in a row on a single stream

Commonly used operations include 1)map
								2)filter
								3)foreach
Two more commonly used are 4)sorted
						   5)collect									
								
Terminal operations - foreach
					- collect - transform elements of a stream into different kind of result

Intermediate operations - map - one value to other
					    - filter - to filter the results using predicate
					    -sorted - returns sorted view of the stream but REMEMBER original collection wont be altered
					    
ELEMENTS IN A COLLECTIONS CAN NOT BE CHANGED OR MUTATED WITH STREAM BUT CAN BE SAVED TO A NEW COLLECTIONS IF THATS WHAT U NEED.

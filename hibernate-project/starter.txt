3 main items that must be in place to work hibernate properly 
	1.Configuration - can be specified via 3 ways
		a.properties file - hibernate.properties 
		b.xml configuration file -hibernate.cfg.xml-  most preferred way
		c.through java code or programmatic configuration.
	(main diff is bw a n b, in a we can only specify connection properties
	we can not map resources(entities) but in xml config we can do both)
	2.Building Session Factory
		when we need to persist , it will obtain singleton session factory from the hibernate util class
		using singleton session factory, it can obtain session
		session basically an interface between our application and hibernate.
		session is the one that helps to perform diff persistence operations
		
		we need to provide a singleton instance of session factory
		so start with private static final
		
		it will throw many exceptions so on high level try catch with Exception e
	
	3.Obtain session and begin transaction and call Persistence methods
	  and create entity and call save/any and  close transaction
	
	
	
	
	
	Configuration - main goal of it is to tell hibernate how it should connect to db - 
	
	1.JAVA BASED Available in Application.java
		
		username,pwd,driver-class,url
		a.get the configuration object
		b.register the annotated classes - must register mapping metadata with configuration
		  metadata basically helps hibernate to construct sql queries and persist the object
		c.set the propertes
			/* Configuration */
			
		a->.Configuration configuration = new Configuration();

		b->.configuration.addAnnotatedClass(StudentAccount.class);

		c->.configuration.setProperties(new Properties() {
			{
				put("hibernate.connection.username", "infinite");
				put("hibernate.connection.password", "skills");
				put("hibernate.connection.driver_class",
						"com.mysql.jdbc.Driver");
				put("hibernate.connection.url",
						"jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/ifinances");
			}
		});
	2.properties based - verify HibernateUtil_properties and Application.java
	2.xml based - verify HibernateUtil_properties and Application.java
